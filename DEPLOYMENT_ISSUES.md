# Deployment Issues for Vercel

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues for Vercel Deployment

This FastAPI application has several features that **will NOT work properly on Vercel** due to platform limitations:

### 1. **File System Limitations**
- **Problem**: Vercel's serverless functions have a **read-only file system** except for `/tmp`
- **Affected Features**:
  - Temporary file creation for PDF/image processing
  - File uploads and downloads
  - The `/tmp` directory has a **512MB limit**

### 2. **Execution Time Limits**
- **Problem**: Vercel has a **10-second timeout** for serverless functions (Hobby plan)
- **Affected Features**:
  - Large PDF conversions
  - Batch image compression
  - Multiple file processing

### 3. **Memory Limitations**
- **Problem**: Vercel functions have **1024MB memory limit** (Hobby plan)
- **Affected Features**:
  - Large PDF processing
  - High-resolution image processing
  - Multiple file operations

### 4. **Binary Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Some Python packages with binary dependencies may not work
- **Affected Packages**:
  - `PyMuPDF` (fitz) - requires system libraries
  - `pillow-heif` - requires HEIF libraries
  - `opencv-python-headless` - may have issues

### 5. **Session Storage**
- **Problem**: In-memory session storage (`REORDER_SESSIONS`) won't persist
- **Affected Features**:
  - PDF reorder tool (sessions will be lost between requests)

## ‚úÖ Alternative Deployment Options

### 1. **Railway.app** (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### 2. **Render.com**
- Supports Docker deployments
- Better file system access
- Longer timeout limits

### 3. **Google Cloud Run**
```bash
# Build and deploy with Docker
gcloud run deploy pdf-converter \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

### 4. **AWS Lambda with EFS**
- Use Elastic File System for file storage
- Longer execution times (15 minutes max)
- More complex setup

### 5. **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- Docker support
- Better for file processing apps
- Reasonable pricing

### 6. **Heroku** (if still using free tier alternatives)
- Good Python support
- File system access
- Suitable for this type of app

## üîß Modifications Needed for Vercel

If you MUST use Vercel, you'll need to:

1. **Use External Storage**:
   - Store files in S3, Cloudinary, or similar
   - Use signed URLs for downloads

2. **Implement Queue System**:
   - Use background jobs with Redis/Celery
   - Return job IDs instead of processed files

3. **Reduce Processing**:
   - Limit file sizes significantly
   - Remove batch processing
   - Simplify compression algorithms

4. **Remove Features**:
   - PDF reordering (needs sessions)
   - Large file support
   - Batch operations

## üìù Recommended: Use Railway or Render

For this application, **Railway.app** or **Render.com** would be much better choices because:
- They support long-running processes
- Full file system access
- Docker support
- Better suited for file processing applications

## For GitHub

The project is **ready for GitHub**. Just run:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_URL
git push -u origin main
```

The `.gitignore` is already configured correctly.
